# protxol-memes
We've open-sourced our memes. This is a list of all memes from Protxol and any meme derivatives popularized on Protxol.

"Protxol" is a shorthand for Protean-Quixol. For context, many of the staff on Quixol ran a minecraft server named Proteancraft before starting Quixol. We have retained a great many Memes from those days, so we've decided to include them here. 

We've divided all memes into two categories: Farm Fresh Memes, and Meme Derivatives. 

Farm Fresh Memes are any memes that are not a variation of an external meme, i.e. they were conjured up solely by the people of Protxol. 
Meme Derivatives are any memes based on pre-existing memes that were re-imagined for Protxol or otherwise became prominent among Protxol members, thus associating those memes with Protxol. 

To properly document each meme, we also have some additional information listed about them: a source (usually a person/people), as well as the era in which the meme emerged. If any information about a meme is unknown we will simply put question marks (???).

To suggest additions changes you can just suggest them to us on discord or in minecraft or wherever you can get in touch with the staff. Or you can just submit a pull request here on github, since it's open source. Yeah!!!
